## Niche Modeling
The concept of of the niche (i.e. the environmental conditions that allow a species' persistence) is almost as old as the field of ecology itself. 
Despite the normial unification and mathematical elegance of the idea, empirically measuring the niche is always challenging due to a variety of logistic and conceptual issues.<br>

I show how Hutchinson's hypervolume can be measured using [a probabilistic framework](http://lvmuyang.github.io/files/MEE_2021.pdf) that allows partitioning niche variation into ecological meaningful components.<br>

The quantifacation of the environmental niche is unavoidably affected by the spatial grain over which it is measured. We develop [a conceptual framework](http://lvmuyang.github.io/files//TREE_2023.pdf) to demonstrate that the scale-dependence of niche geometry can be predicted from three key ecological factors: geographic range size, habitat specialiation, and environmental heterogeneity. 
Using [a novel climate change vulnerability measure](http://lvmuyang.github.io/files/GCB_2025.pdf), we show that due to the scale-dependence of the measured environmental niche, coarse-grain analysis can seriously underestimate the extincion risk of tropical species.<br>

While the intra-specific variation of the niche is widely acknowledged, the mathematical relationship between the species' niche and the individual niche remains elusive, hampering the integration of individual level data to address macroecological questions. 
I show that there is [a simple but powerful analytical relationship](http://lvmuyang.github.io/files/PNAS_2025.pdf) between the species' niche and the individual niche that opens up many opportunities to invesitigate ecological and evolutionary topics using a bottom-up approach.
