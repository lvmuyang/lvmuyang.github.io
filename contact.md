## Prospective Students
I will be recruiting a master student to join my group at Sichuan University in **2027**. 

If you are interested, please send me an email containing:
- A brief cover letter outlining your research interests, relevant academic/technical experience, and motivations for joining my group.

Preferred qualifications:
- A bachelor’s degree in ecology, statistics, physics, applied mathematics, computer science, or a related field.
- Strong quantitative skills, including proficiency in programming languages (e.g., R/Python) and formal training in probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.
- Above all, a willingness to learn and innovate.

## Undergraduate research assistants
Undergraduate students interested in my research are welcome to inquire about research opportunities at any time.

## Mentoring style
I see students as junior colleagues, not just mentees. You will have the freedom to pursue your own research interests even if they don’t fully align with mine. I don’t take a highly hands-on approach to projects, but I will guarantee weekly one-on-one meetings to offer guidance and address questions or challenges.
