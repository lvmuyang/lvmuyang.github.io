## Prospective Students
I will be recruiting a master student to join my research group at Sichuan University in **2027**. 

If you are interested, please send me an email containing:
- A brief cover letter outlining your research interests, relevant academic/technical experience, and motivations for joining my group.
Please read at least some of my publications and tell me what you like or dislike (even better).

Preferred qualifications:
- A bachelor’s degree in ecology, statistics, physics, applied mathematics, computer science, or a related field.
- Strong quantitative skills, including familiarity with programming languages (e.g., R/Python) and formal training in probability theory, statistics, and linear algebra.

## Undergraduate research assistants
Undergraduate students interested in my research are welcome to inquire about research opportunities at any time.

## Mentoring style
I view my students more as junior colleagues than mentees. You will have the freedom and independence to explore your own research interests, even if they do not fully align with my focus areas. While I do not adopt a highly hands-on approach to research projects, I guarantee weekly one-on-one meetings to provide guidance, discuss progress, and address any questions or challenges you may encounter.
